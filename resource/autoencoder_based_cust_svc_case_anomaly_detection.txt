This tutorial is for anaomaly detection for service time for an issue processing system  data using 
auto encoder. 
 

Environment
===========
Path etc shown here corresposnds to my environment. Please Change them  as needed  for your 
environment


Python dependency
=================
The shell script commands for data generation run python scripts for data generation. Before you run 
the data generation commands do the following
1. checkout project avenir
2. copy the directories  avenir/python/lib  avenir/python/mlextra and avenir/python/unsup directory to ../lib 
../mlextra and ../unsup with respect to your location of cpu_usage.py file


Create normal data for modeling
===============================
./ticket.py genx <num_issues> > cus_tr.txt

where
num_issues = number of issues e.g 2000


Create test data
================
./ticket.py genx <num_issues> > cus.txt
where
num_issues = number of issues e.g 200

insert outliers
/ticket.py iolx  cus.txt <outlier_percentage> > cus_te.txt

where
<outlier_percentage = outlier percentage e.g 10

Train Auto Encoder
==================
 ./ticket.py train  ae_ticket.properties
 Make sure the following are set
 train.model.save=True
 
 Model hyper parameters are tuned manually. Feel free to change and experiment by editing the file
 ae_ticket.properties
 
 Test for regeneration error
 ===========================
 ./ticket.py regen ae_ticket.properties
 A file called rol.txt has the output
 
 Regeneration error upper tail stat
 ==================================
 ./ticket.py utstat  rol.txt
 
 Histogram of regeneration error
 ===============================
 ./ticket.py hist  rol.txt
