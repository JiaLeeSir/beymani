This tutorial is for time series anomaly detection for machinary vibration  data using sub sequence
dissimilarity

Dependent script
================
Checkout the project avenir. Copy the lib  directory under python to a directory  at the same level
as your working directory forp python script

Build and Deployment
====================
Please refer to resorce/spark_dependency.txt for building all jars and the final uber jar filw

Script and configuration
========================
Feel free to make changes in script exp_spark.sh and the configuration file exp.conf as per you
environment

Generate input
==============
-Copy bvib.py from python/app to your workig directory.

-Generate vibration  data 
./bvib.py gen <num_secs> > v.txt

where
num_secs = num of secs in past for which vibration data data is generated e.g 7

-Split into reference and prediction data
split -l10000 v.txt
mv xaa vib_ref.txt

-Insert outliers in prediction or test data data
./bvib.py  iol xab  <failure_onset_time> > vib_pred.txt
failure_onset_time = time from beginning of test data where  outlier in inserted. Outlier is 
in the form of 2 high frequecy componenets

-You could plot the data around where outliers were introduced as follows
./bvib.py iplot vib_pred.txt K87JG9F6  900 1100

K87JG9F6  is the ID of the machine that is faulty and has outliers in the vibration data

-Copy reference and prediction data
cp vib_ref.txt ./other/vib/
cp vib_pred.txt ./input/vib/


Run Spark Job
=============
Run
./vib.sh olPred

Plot outlier data
=================
./bvib.py oplot ./output/vib/part-00000 K87JG9F6  900 1100

K87JG9F6  is the ID of the machine that is faulty and has outliers in the vibration data
