This tutorial is forconcept  drift detection of supervised machine learning  models with EDDM algorithm


Setup
=====
Make sure you have python/lib directory of avenir project with all the python files wrt 
where codrift.py is as a peer directory i.e at ../lib  Copy sucodr.py from beymani/python/lob 
directory to your lib directory

Generate Data
=============
- Generate refrence model prediction data 
./codrift.py agen <nsamp> <er_rate> > er1.txt
where
nsamp = num of samples e.g. 2000
er_rate = error rate e.g 0.1

- Generate model prediction data with drift present
./codrift.py agen <nsamp> <er_rate> <trans> <dr_er_rate> > er2.txt
where
trans = transition point for drift e.g 0.4 which means drift will appear after
the first 40% of the data
dr_er_rate = increased error rate after drift e.g 0.2

Create reference statistics
===========================
Make sure you have directory called  model under the working directory

Run
./codrift.py eddm er1.txt true <bootstrap_size>
where 
bootstrap_size = no of samples to be used boot strapping and creating referenece statistic e.g 600
it will detect drift for the remaining samples. In our case it won't because er1.txt does not contain
any error data with drift

Detect drift
============
./codrift.py eddm er2.txt
In our case drift will be detected, because about half way through the error data, the error rate dobles
to simulate drift. For real prouction data, you may or may not find drift
