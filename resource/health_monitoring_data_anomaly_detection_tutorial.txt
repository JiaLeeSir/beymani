This tutorial is for anaomaly detection in health monitoring data. Sequence anomaly is detected 
with markov chain model. 
 
Environment
===========
Path etc shown here corresposnds to my environment. Please Change them  as needed  for your 
environment. The script bsm.sh is for running spark jobs and various other tasks. The configuration 
is in bsm.conf

Build
=====
Follow instructions in spark_dependency.txt

Python dependency
=================
The shell script commands for data generation run python scripts for data generation. Before you run 
the data generation commands do the following
1. checkout project avenir
2. copy the avenir/python/lib directory to ../lib with respect to your location of cpu_usage.py file

Create device reading mean and std dev
======================================
./bls.py stat <num_dev> > dstat.txt

num_dev = number of devices e.g 200

Create training data
====================
./bls.py gen dstat.txt <nun_days> normal > <train_data_file>
where
nun_days = num of days for which data should be generated (e.g 300)
train_data_file = training data file

Copy <train_data_file>  to the spark input directory.
cp <train_data_file> ./input/bsm/train

Copy meta data file
====================
cp bsm.json ./meta

Discretize training data
========================
Run dicretization spark job
./bsm.sh transformTrain

Discretization step is set to 5 in bsm.conf

Build model
===========
Run Spark job
./bsm.sh stateTrans

Consolidate model files
=======================
Copy all Spark generated files into one
./bsm.sh cpModel

Create test data
================
Create test data with outliers
./bls.py gen dstat.txt <nun_days> anomaly > <test_data_file>
nun_days = num of days for which data should be generated (e.g 30)
test_data_file = test data file name

Copy file
cp  <test_data_file> ./input/bsm/pred

Discretize test data
====================
Run dicretization spark job
./bsm.sh transformPred

Anomaly prediction Spark job
============================
./bsm.sh olPredict
