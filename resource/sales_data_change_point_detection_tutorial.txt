This tutorial is for time series change point detection for retail sales data

Dependent script
================
Checkout the project avenir. Copy the lib and mlextra directory under python to a directory  at the same level
as your working directory forp python script

Build and Deployment
====================
Please refer to resorce/spark_dependency.txt for building all jars and the final uber jar filw

Script and configuration
========================
Feel free to make changes in script exp_spark.sh and the configuration file exp.conf as per you
environment

Generate input
==============
Copt cpsale.py from python/app to your workig directory.
Generate hourly sales data 
./cpsale.py gen <num_days> > cps.txt

num_days = num of days in past for which sales data data is generated

Generate distribution for CVM two ssample statistic
===================================================
We use Monte Carlo simulation to generate distribution. When run it will output to the console 
upper tail statistic. Save the output somewhere. You will need it to configure the Spark job

Checkout the project avenir. In the python/app directory run the following

./tsstat.py <num_iter> cvm <num_samo>
num_iter = num of iterations for the simulator e.g 2000
num_samp = num of samples for generated samples, which should be half the window size (the parameter
window.size in cpsale.conf). I have set this parameter to 200. So num_samp should be 100

You could skip this step, if use the values set for parameter stat.critValue

Copy input to Spark directory
=============================
./cpsale.sh cpInp cps.txt

Run Spark Job
=============
Chhose an upper  critical value for confidence interval any wher between .95 and .99 from the
output of the MC simulator we ran earlier. Set the parameter stat.critValue in cpsale.conf

Run
./cpsale.sh cpPred

Plot sales data and change points
=================================
./cpsale.py plot cps.txt DK75HUI45X ./output/cpsale/part-00000

DK75HUI45X  is the ID of the product that change point in sales data
